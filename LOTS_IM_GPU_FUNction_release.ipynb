      "    FUNCTION'S SUMMARY:\n",
      "    Main function of the LOTS-IM algorithm running on GPU. This function produces (i.e. saving)\n",
      "    irregularity maps that indicate level of irregularity of voxels in brain FLAIR MRI, either\n",
      "    in slice (2D) or volume (3D). This function read MRI data from a single subject (i.e., only\n",
      "    1 MRI data for each run). Please note that the data is retrieved as a 3D numpy array (i.e.,\n",
      "    whole MRI volume).\n",
      "    \n",
      "    By default, the irregularity maps are calculated by using four different sizes of source/target\n",
      "    patches (i.e. 1x1, 2x2, 4x4, and 8x8) and 64 target samples. Furthermore, all intermediary\n",
      "    files are saved in .mat (Matlab) while the irregularity map can be saved as either JPEG files\n",
      "    (optional) or Nifti file. For now, only Nifti is supported for output file.\n",
